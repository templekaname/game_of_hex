# game_of_hex
Game of Life explored in hexagonal grid

This is a repository for the programming & algorithms project.\
This repository contains 3 code files (`hex_rules`, `hex_visualize`, `hex_run`), output samples (`.gif` files), and a report (`main.pdf`).\
To run the code, you need to use **hex_run**.\
Running this file creates a sequence of images and a simple gif image.\
But before running, you must create a directory (whatever name you wish, but it is referred to as 'images' in the program) !\
For the details please refer to the report.
