# game_of_hex
Game of Life explored in hexagonal grid

This is a repository for the programming & algorithms project.
This repository contains 3 code files (hex_rules, hex_visualize, hex_run) and output samples (.gif files).
To run the code, you need to use **hex_run**.
Running this file creates a sequence of images and a simple gif image.
But before running, you must create a directory (whatever name you wish, but it is referred to as 'images' in the program) !
